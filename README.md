========================================================

__Rough__ notes on GitHub usage in STAT 545:

  * <http://stat545-ubc.github.io/bit004_stat545-use-of-github.html>
  * 2015-06: GitHub [recently announced lots of improvements](https://github.com/blog/2020-improved-organization-permissions) to GitHub Organizations, so my course usage will get much more sane in fall 2015!
