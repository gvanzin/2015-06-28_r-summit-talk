Engaging new UseRs with R Markdown, Git, and GitHub

Every year I teach graduate courses in exploratory data analysis and
statistics for high-dimensional biology. For each run, we attract ~40
motivated grad students from a variety of programs and
backgrounds. Recently, we've had a very rewarding experience
integrating R Markdown, Git and GitHub into these courses. The
benefits include

  * reduced webmaster burdens for the instructor
  * easier dissemination of code and reports
  * enhanced code-focused interactions, both instructor <--> student
    and student <--> student

I'll discuss how we use these tools to create a lively R-focused
community in the classroom.
